Design for Weight Composition Project:

NOTE: input and output classes need to be fleshed out further.

public class BalanceWeightSystem
- Calculates solution to weight composition problem, given a family of weights
      and a total weight.
    public WeightSolution calculateSolution(WeightFamily family, int desiredTotalWeight)
    - Given a family of weights and a total weight, calculate and return a minimum-sized
      collection of weights such that the sum of the weights of the solution is the
      given total weight.
public class WeightSystemInput
- Input interface class. NEEDS METHODS.
    public InputInterface()
    - Create a new input interface object.
public class WeightSystemOutput
- Output interface class. NEEDS METHODS.
    public OutputInterface()
    - Create a new output interface object
public class Weight implements Comparable<Weight>
- Represents a weight in weight composition problem.
    public Weight(int weight)
    - Create a new weight object with a given weight value.
    public int getWeight()
    - Return the weight value associated with this weight.
    public int CompareTo(Weight other)
    - Compares this Weight with the parameter for order.
public interface WeightCollection
    - General specification for a collection of weights
    public Collection<Weight> getWeights()
    - Return the collection of weights associated with this object.
    public int size()
    - Return the size of this collection of weights.
    public boolean isEmpty()
    - Return true if this collection contains no weights.
public class WeightFamily implements WeightCollection
    - Represents a family of weights in weight composition problem.
    public WeightFamily(Set<Weight> familyOfWeights)
    - Create a new WeightFamily object based on a given family of weights.
    public Collection<Weight> getWeights()
    - Return the collection of weights associated with this object.
    public int size()
    - Return the size of this collection of weights.
    public boolean isEmpty()
    - Return true if this collection contains no weights.
    public Weight getSmallestWeight()
    - Return the smallest weight contained in this family of weights.
public class WeightSolution implements WeightCollection
    - Represents a solution to the weight composition problem, i.e., a minimum-sized
      collection of weights.
    public WeightSolution()
    - Creates a new empty solution collection.
    public WeightSolution(WeightCollection weights)
    - Creates a new solution collection using an existing collection of weights.
    public WeightSolution(Collection<Weight> weights)
    - Creates a new solution collection using an existing WeightCollection
    public Collection<Weight> getWeights()
    - Return the collection of weights associated with this object.
    public int size()
    - Return the size of this collection of weights.
    public boolean isEmpty()
    - Return true if this collection contains no weights.
